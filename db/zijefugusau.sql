Though in contemporary day community development could be said to be new, but in Islamic point of view it is there for over one thousand years, with the advent of Islam in this world of ours. Because the basis upon which Islamic legislation and instrumentation is based in term of its philosophy, implications, latent effect and intent is to eradicate and uproot evil in form of all its ramifications and establish good with all its benefits. And this is what community development is all about. The paper aims at making elaborations on the provisions made in Islam, in terms of the intents in Islamic legislation and instrumentation, in bringing about positive development and better living for all. This is within the scope of the benefits and prevention of harm by Shari’ah as posited by Alghazali: the essentials (dharuriyyat), the complementary (Hajiyyat) and the embellishments (Tahseeniyyat). It employed a descriptive approach that employed literature review. The findings of the paper show, among others, that community development is reflected and based in the first of the benefits of Shari’ah as its intent called dharuriyyat, as mentioned by al- Ghazali, that refers to taking care of (1) Human self; (2) Faith; (3) Intellect; (4) Posterity (or Procreation); and (5) Wealth (or Property). It is therefore recommended that in community development activities the above five should be protected and projected by all means possible.

D.', 'Re-structuring Secondary School Chemistry Education for National and Economic Development in Nigeria', 'This paper examines the need to re-structure of Secondary School Chemistry Education for National and Economy Development in Nigeria. Chemistry Education is considered as a key agent of development, either as a way of developing human capacity, increasing the skilled workforce for modernization, developing capability and empowerment.  Nigeria, as a nation, is still wadding in a muddy pull in seeking for the right way to terminate her total dependence on foreign nations for technological expertise in fields of Science and Technology. The nation has produced many scientists, engineers and technologist yet we import services and goods in these fields from other countries which resulted in a recessed economy. This paper therefore discussed the loopholes in the present secondary school chemistry education and recommended the way forward in terms of restructuring the curriculum themes to produce a functional chemistry education, rebranding the chemistry practical activities to integrate improvisation with locally available materials and chemical processes designed to meet the need of the society (and not just rote learning of titration and cation/anion analysis of procured chemical compounds),  introduction of remedial teaching plan for mastery learning strategy, introducing Science Mini Project (SMP) for Senior Secondary Students using available local materials as part of SSCE formative assessment scores. This would build a solid foundation that would usher in a new era of creative and innovative students who are prepared for post- secondary industrial work and at the same time could proceed with higher confidence and adequate creative potential and practical skills to higher education in any science and technological field.

D.', 'Model-Based Inquiry as a Viable Strategy for Chemistry Instruction in Colleges of Education in Nigeria: An Overview', 'Chemistry education at the National Certificate in Education (NCE) level is designed to produce competent chemistry teachers with the capacity to further encourage the spirit of inquiry and creativity in the learners and to apply the skills and knowledge to solve day-to-day problems. These objectives are yet to be appreciably achieved because of the glaring mismatch between the quality of pre-service Chemistry teachers and their service delivery. The ability of Pre-service Chemistry teachers in particular to select and utilize the appropriate instructional techniques in their delivery, is a function of the training they received from Colleges of Education (COEs). However, COEs often fail to equip pre-service teachers for their obligations in workplaces due to reliance on ineffective teaching methods. Thus, pre-service teachers are rendered passive and observers rather than being active participants in the classroom. These practices impede their interest and the acquisition of requisite knowledge and professional skills. Educators recommended the use of activity-based strategies such as the inquiry. Despite the merits of inquiry approach, it has not been satisfactorily utilized to produce the desired result as students still do laboratory verifications by closely following directions and memorizing what textbooks and/or lecturers indicated as truth about the natural world. Hence the proposition for the use of reformed innovative inquiry approaches such as Model Based Inquiry (MBI). The activities in MBI focus learners not only on investigative material activities as in the Conventional Inquiry (CI) but also on deep subject matter understanding and the provision to develop a platform of understanding (a model) to inform their previous knowledge, questions and hypotheses. The paper gives a rationale for this optimism and a sample lesson plan to this effect. It has been recommended that teacher educators adopting MBI must not make inquiry/modeling processes too abstract to enable prospective teachers apply the experience at places of their primary assignment.
